    <h1>Types of List</h1>
    <p>Lists in HTML are a way to group related items together. They can be used for various purposes, such as displaying steps in a process, creating a menu, or organizing content in a structured way. HTML provides three main types of lists: ordered lists, unordered lists, and definition lists.</p>
